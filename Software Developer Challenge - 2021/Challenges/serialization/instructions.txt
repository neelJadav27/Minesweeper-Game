Serialization and Deserialization
=================================

Problem Definition
------------------

You are tasked with designing a network protocol for a simple online game. The users of the game can send chat messages,
and move around in the game world. Please see Message, ChatMessage, and PositionMessage for the content of these messages.
Because we want to use the user's bandwidth as efficiently as possible, the ideal protocol should use as little bandwidth as possible.

Design a protocol for serializing these messages, and implement both a serializer and a deserializer.
The implementation should be done in SerializerImpl and DeserializerImpl by implementing the Serializer and Deserializer interfaces, respectively.
Make sure to check out the parameter descriptions for the deserializer.

The test harness loads sample messages from disk, and run them through your serializer, then your deserializer, to verify they come out the end
exactly like they went in. It will print out the total bytes transmitted, count of correct messsages, as well as any problems with the received messages.

Other information:
- The game world is 1024 units wide by 1024 units tall.
- Usernames are 16 characters maximum
- Chat messages are 512 characters maximum


Restrictions
------------
- Don't use any built in compression tools (GZIPOutputStream, etc)
- Don't use any third party compression or serialization tools
- Please do not submit hidden files (.idea, .DS_Store, Thumbs.db, etc) with your solution.
